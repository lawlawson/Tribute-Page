        Arsene Wenger OBE born 22 October 1949, is a French football manager. He
        has been the manager of Arsenal Football Club since 1996, becoming the
        clubs longest serving manager and most successful in terms of major
        titles won.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Last season, he passed the 1000-game mark in the Gunners’ dugout, and
        led Arsenal to a record-equalling 11th FA Cup win.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        His first silverware with the club came in the form of a domestic
        ‘double’ in 1997/98, a feat matched in 2001/02. Memorably, he then
        guided the team to a remarkable unbeaten league title - the only one
        achieved in the modern era - in 2003/04. On top of this, there have been
        two more FA Cup wins during his reign and a Champions League final
        appearance in 2006.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Renowned as a true footballing innovator both stylistically and behind
        the scenes - to the latter end, he played a big part in the conception
        and design of Emirates Stadium and the Training Ground - Arsène has
        stamped his own brand of attacking football on the club, one that is now
        acknowledged worldwide as being synonymous with the Gunners’ name.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        He is also well known for his development of young players, and his
        commitment towards preparing them for football careers in the best way
        possible.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        An economics graduate from Strasbourg University, multilingual Arsène
        has also received an honorary DSc from the University of Hertfordshire -
        as well as the French Legion D’Honneur, an honorary OBE in this country
        and the Freedom of the Borough of Islington.
